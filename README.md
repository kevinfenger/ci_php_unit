CI Steps 
1) Place the two libraries in the libaries directory
    a) Mostly all of the code lives here and drives everything you need to have 
       a successful unit testin environment. 
 
2) Place the views in the views directory 
    a) Modify as you see fit, this is just an example of how to do this. 

3) Place run_all_tests.php in the Controllers directory 
    a) This will run all tests in the model directory you specify

* TODO update steps to run tests from the browser/CLI.
